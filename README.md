# NgxTranslateApp

NgxTranslateApp is an editor for the language json files from ngx-translate (https://github.com/ngx-translate/). It's a simple yet functional tool that eases viewing and editing the content of the json files. It is an Angular 9 web app with no backend, all happens in your computer.

You can try it here: https://elnezah.github.io/ngx-translate-app/

It looks like this:

# Instructions

* Drag your files to the area at the bottom left. 
* Find the key you want to edit in the tree view on the left. 
* Edit all you need. You can add a sybling (or son, depending on what's selected) by clicking + on the top right.
* Don't forget to save your work (top most right), this will "download" your json files
* Replace the json files in your project for the ones you just got.

If you see something highlighted in red, there is a missing translation.

# Work in progress

This is a personal project in progress. As far as tested, it works just fine, but I don't get responsible is something goes wrong with your trasnlations.

## Comming...

I plan to prettyfy the UI, add a search function and maybe someday make it possible to git pull and commit directly from the app. It will probably take loooong. Help is wellcome üòä

( And I also need to translate the tool itself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è )
